CM10.1-In-Estonian-Language
===========================

Estonian language translations by me for CM10.1 JB 4.2.2 ....
Please do not add these to CM repository, not even if you edit these..
I do my best to get my Nexus better and I don't want anybody to steal my work or something like that! :D

If you want to use these in your ROM, then feel free, also it would be great if you put credits or something like that then... :)

To add custom languages to your ROM you must edit ~/build/target/product/ locales and language .mk files and there is also one another file..
