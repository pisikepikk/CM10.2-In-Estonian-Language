CM10.2-In-Estonian-Language
===========================

Estonian language translations by me for CM10.2 JB 4.3.x (AOSP strings translations are not my translated but some of them are my edited by me.)
Please do not add these to CM repositories, not even if you edit these my translations.
I do my best to get my Nexus better and I don't want anybody to steal my work or something like that! :D

If you want to use these in your ROM, then feel free, also it would be great if you put credits or something like that then... :)

To add custom languages to your ROM you must edit ~/build/target/product/ locales and language .mk sdk.mk files, also you need xx-rXX folder to fraeworks/base/core/res/res/ to make that language visibe on the Settings. If you want you can add custom locale to: buildspec.mk.default file, line 78 #CUSTOM_LOCALES:=
